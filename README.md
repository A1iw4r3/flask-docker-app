# flask-docker-app
Dockerfile for Flask Application

# Description

This Dockerfile sets up a container environment using Python 3.8 as the base image. It exposes port 5000 and sets the working directory to '/app'. It copies the 'app.py' file into the container's '/app' directory, installs Flask using pip, sets the FLASK_APP environment variable to 'app.py', and specifies the command to run the Flask application with the host set to '0.0.0.0'. This Dockerfile is suitable for deploying a Flask web application.
